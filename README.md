Water Quality Analysis Project
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing water quality parameters to assess the overall condition of water resources and identify potential contamination issues. The goal is to understand how various physical and chemical parameters influence water potability and relate these findings to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 — Clean Water and Sanitation.

Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project highlights trends, correlations, and insights that can guide environmental monitoring, public health initiatives, and policy-making.

1. 🌍 Relevance to SDG 6

SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

This project contributes to SDG 6 by:

Promoting awareness about water quality and pollution indicators.

Demonstrating data-driven approaches to assess water safety.

Laying a foundation for predictive modeling to support clean water initiatives in the future.

2. 🧪 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains various parameters that determine water quality, such as:

pH — Measure of acidity/basicity.

Turbidity — Clarity of water.

Dissolved Oxygen (DO) — Oxygen available in water.

Conductivity — Indicates ion concentration.

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) — Measure of inorganic salts.

Hardness, Chloramines, Sulfate, Organic Carbon, and other indicators.

Data was analyzed using Python-based tools to identify relationships and derive insights about water health.

3. ⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn — for data analysis and visualization

4. 📊 Key Analysis Steps

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing parameter distributions, trends, and correlations.

Statistical Insights: Identifying key parameters influencing water quality.

Result Interpretation: Drawing actionable conclusions for environmental sustainability.

5. 💡 Results and Insights

Identified critical parameters affecting water quality.

Detected regions or samples exceeding safe thresholds.

Generated visual summaries for better public understanding of water conditions.

6. 🔭 Future Scope

Implementation of Machine Learning models (e.g., classification and regression) to predict potability.

Integration with IoT-based sensors for real-time monitoring.

Development of interactive dashboards for policymakers and citizens.
